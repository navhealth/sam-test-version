  How to use this orb to manage repos that use bumpversion to manage the version for a given repo.
  This will bump the version **with** comparison of versions between the current branch and the master branch.
  This will bump the version if the current branch is "eq" (ie equal) to the master branch.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    version: carejourney/versionv2@1

  jobs:
    bumpversion:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/python:3.8-node
      steps:
        - version/bump-using-bumpversion:
            segment: patch
            compare_branch: master
            comparison_predicate: eq

  workflows:
    version-bump:
      jobs:
        - bumpversion
